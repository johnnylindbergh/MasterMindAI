# MasterMindAI
This is an AI for the board game "Master Mind"

# Method
The "AI" (which is really not an AI) computes all possible sequences of a set of colors of a given length. The AI uses prime numbers assosiated with each color in order to determine if a color sequence is an rearragement of another in linear time. The AI uses a process of elimination to find the sequence in as few guesses as possible.
